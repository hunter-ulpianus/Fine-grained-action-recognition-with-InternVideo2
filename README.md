# Fine-grained-action-recognition-with-InternVideo2
This project extends InternVideo2, a general-purpose vision foundation model, by introducing a Region-of-Interest (ROI) Alignment Module and proposing a branch-based training strategy for feature fusion. These innovations significantly enhance multimodal foundation models' capability in comprehending fine-grained information.
